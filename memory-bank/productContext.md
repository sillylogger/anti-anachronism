# Product Context

## Purpose
- This project exists because many of the photos in my Google Photos timeline have inaccuate metadata.  There is no plugin to Google Photos that would intelligently update photo's datetime metadata based on the photo's filename.

## Problems Solved
- Identifying photos with inaccurate datetime metadata based on datetime data extracted from their filename.
- Bulk updates of Google Photos' metadata.

## User Experience Goals
- Expose all Google Photos' metadata through a CSV for review in a spreadsheet.
- Based on a manually created CSV, the project should update the metadata in Google Photos.
