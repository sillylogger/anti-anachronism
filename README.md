## Anti-Anachronism; Google Photo Edition

Have you moved from Adobe Lightroom to Google Photos because Lightroom is *rife* with sync issues? ðŸ™‹  
Are you fed up with your Photo timeline's cronological inconsistency?! ðŸ™‹  
Well say no more!

Simply:
* checkout this project
* yak model responsibilities
* remember Google Photo's API doesn't support upating photos that weren't uploaded by the app.
    See: <https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/manage-media> and note **"To change a media item's description, your app must have uploaded the media item"**.

## TODO
- [x] Pull all your albums and photos down from Google Photos
- [x] Write the metadata to a CSV, upload to Google Sheets: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KJ3bmt1csh_zfdnxMHveVQKlVgu0Ww78XuhaeFWAg0I/edit#gid=1936910659)
- [x] Fix the mediaMetadata of one photo on Google Photos via console => **ðŸ¤¦ not possible** per [issue tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues?q=status:open%20componentid:385336%20edit)
- [ ] Write a bunch of regular expressions to compare creationTime with a DateTime from the filename
      Need to match the most specific regex first, otherwise truncating information like the time part of the filename
- [ ] Add the DateTime from filename to the CSV and fix a few via Google Sheets
